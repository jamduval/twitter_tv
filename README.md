# Examining Television Viewership Through Twitter


--------------------


#### Can the Nielsen household rating be predicted from tweets by Twitter users?

Final project for the General Assembly Data Science course completed December 8, 2015, DAT-DC-9


For some people, watching television in the evening is a cathartic way to de-stress from a 
hectic daily schedule. With such a wide range of programs to choose from, between reality 
programming such as *The Voice* or *Keeping Up With the Kardashians* and scripted programming 
such as *Arrested Development* or *Pushing Daisies*, there is something for everyone to enjoy. 
Currently, Nielsen household ratings are second to none for advertisers; telling them whether 
or not to pay a network to advertise their product during a program. As viewers flock to other 
mediums for TV viewing, however, these ratings are growing out of date with each passing year. 
No one likes to see their favorite program go off the air prematurely, and being able to 
properly leverage other data sources such as Twitter to capture their viewing behavior might be 
the key to saving a show from cancellation in the future.
